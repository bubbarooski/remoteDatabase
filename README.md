# Why?
This is a fun little project I thought of that is a spin off from a project I did in my undergrad. I wanted to make it more complex, so that it would be challenging, but also so I could learn new things. I wanted to use a dataset that I feel like I know very well and would have some use to me (didnt win either of the fantasy football leagues that I'm in, womp womp). I feel comfortable in Python and I want to make sure that my C skills are still sharp, hence why I chose those two languages!

# Server
I have accessed API's before but I have never made my own so I wanted to use this project as a chance to do so. I will be using Flask as the framework for the API server and it will run on a Raspberry Pi on my local network.

# Client
The client will be a simple terminal based windows app that can connect to the server and query data from it. Im toying with the idea of having it be a SQL like language that you can use that is than translated into the API calls but its all a work in progress.
