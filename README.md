# Why?
This project is being done as a learning experience for a few different things:
  - How do databases work: I know SQL and have a high level understanding of how a database works, but by implementing my own using best practices, I can gain a deeper understanding.
  - REST API's: I have some experience connecting to and making requests to API's, but by implementing my own, I can gain a better understanding of them and practice networking techniques.
  - C Practice: C is a difficult language and the only way to get better is to practice. I feel decently comfortable in the language so I was okay with doing a more complex project like this.
  - Flask: I wanted to learn a web framework but I didn't want to learn another lanuage on top of the rest of the project, so I knew I was gonna use Python. I went with Flash because it was more lightweight and will do all the things I need it to do.

# Server
A Raspberry Pi is hosting a custom made SQL database. This database is very simple and you can create/drop tables, insert/drop rows, and search with where clauses using standard SQL syntax. The database will also have the functionality to import a CSV file after making a table with matching column names (I wanted to add one extra functionality that made it a little more complicated and different).
